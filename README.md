# Avatar Facial Expression Recognition

This repository provides code that investigates the performance of facial recognition classifiers on avatar faces.

The work of this repository is used for academic purposes and builds on the following repositories:
* [nvdiffrast](https://github.com/NVlabs/nvdiffrast)
* [Deep3DFaceRecon_pytorch](https://github.com/sicxu/Deep3DFaceRecon_pytorch)

## Tasks

The codebase performs the following tasks in the order listed:
* Image restoration: Ingest a lower-resolution, grayscale image and output an RGB, higher-resolution image.
* Image inpainting: TODO
* Facial landmark estimation: Estimate five facial keypoints and save output.
* 3D facial reconstruction: Generate a 3D representation of the input image.
* Facial expression transfer to arbitrary avatar: TODO
* Facial expression recognition: TODO
